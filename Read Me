I was not able to meet all of the requirements of the assignment. 
Some details do not meet a high standard of quality. 
Most problematic was that I couldn't get the weather forecast 
and the map to update at the same time. The style is also pretty poor.

Although I was not able to complete the project to a high standard, 
I really enjoyed the process, improved my PHP skills, learned about OpenweatherAPI,
got better at dealing with JSON and learned a little bit about Maps Javascript API by Google.
