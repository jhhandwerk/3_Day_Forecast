I was not able to meet all of the requirements of the assignment. 
Some details do not meet a high standard of quality. 
Most problematic was that I couldn't get the weather forecast 
and the map to update at the same time. The style also needs a lot of work.
In spite of that, I really enjoyed the process, improved my PHP skills, learned
about OpenWeatherMap API, got better at dealing with JSON and learned a little 
bit about Maps Javascript API by Google.

In order to make this work you will need to add a Google API key on line 11 as well as an
Openweathermap API key on line 125.
