# 3_Day_Forecast
This is a simple web app that gives you a 3 day weather forecast 
for any postal code in Japan. It also allows you to search a map 
on the same page. 

I used PHP to get and display the weather forecast. I used JavaScript
provided in the Google API documentation for the map. Unfortunately, I 
was not able to get the weather forecast and the map to load on the same 
click. If anyone reading this has any input about how to fix this problem, 
feel free. 

I developed and tested this using xampp.
